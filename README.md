# Complimentinator-cpp ✨

**Do you ever feel like your amazing coding skills go unnoticed? 🤔**

Your fingers fly across the keyboard ⌨️, crafting lines of code that are practically works of art (well, at least to you 😉). You solve problems with the elegance of a seasoned ninja 🥷 and debug bugs like a superhero 🦸. But where's the recognition? Where's the applause? 👏

**Fear not, fellow coder!** 😌

There's a distinct lack of audience in your terminal window 🖥️, and let's be honest, sometimes even your cat 🐈 (or dog) doesn't seem that impressed.

**But now, there's hope! 🎉**

This revolutionary package (and by "revolutionary," we mostly mean "slightly ridiculous" 😜) is here to change that.

**Introducing Complimentinator-cpp! 💥**

A state-of-the-art (okay, maybe not *that* state-of-the-art 😅) CLI tool built with the **raw power of C++ 💪** (because efficiency is key when showering yourself with praise 🚿), Complimentinator-cpp will blast you with **overly enthusiastic** (and slightly ridiculous 😂) compliments to boost your ego (or at least make you chuckle 😄).

**It's like having your own personal cheerleader 📣, except way more efficient and without the pom-poms.**

**Still not convinced? 🤔**

Think about it this way: before, only you (and maybe that one time you accidentally left a Stack Overflow answer open in public 😳) knew how awesome you are. But now, there are at least **3 entities** (you, me, and this package) that will recognize your work. That's a **200% increase in recognition! 💯**

**How to Use:**

1. Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g complimentinator-cpp
```

2. Run complimentinator in your terminal:

```bash
complimentinator
```

3. Sit back, relax, and bask in the glorious glow of your newfound (and slightly self-inflicted) appreciation. 😎

Example Output:

```bash
Your coding skills are so amazing, they could probably debug reality itself! ✨
```

Or maybe:

```bash
Eres más listo que un ajo. 🧄 (You're smarter than a garlic!)
```

**Why C++?**

Because delivering compliments with maximum performance 🏎️ is serious business! 😉 (Also, it's a fun way to demonstrate using native addons with Node.js 🤓.)

**Contributing:**

Pull requests are welcome! Especially for:

- More ridiculously over-the-top compliments (in any language! 🌍).
- Bug fixes (though hopefully there aren't any! 🙏).
- Improvements to the CLI or build process 🛠️.

**Known Issues:**

_May cause excessive smiling. Use with caution._ 😄
