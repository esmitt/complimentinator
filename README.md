Do you ever feel like your amazing coding skills go unnoticed?

Your fingers fly across the keyboard, crafting lines of code that are practically works of art (well, at least to you). You solve problems with the elegance of a seasoned ninja and debug bugs like a superhero. But where's the recognition? Where's the applause?

Fear not, fellow coder!

There's a distinct lack of audience in your terminal window, and let's be honest, sometimes even your cat doesn't seem that impressed.

But now, there's hope!

This revolutionary package (and by "revolutionary," we mostly mean "slightly ridiculous") is here to change that.

Introducing Complimentinator-cpp!

A state-of-the-art (okay, maybe not that state-of-the-art) CLI tool built with the raw power of C++ (because efficiency is key when showering yourself with praise), Complimentinator-cpp will blast you with overly enthusiastic (and slightly ridiculous) compliments to boost your ego (or at least make you chuckle).

It's like having your own personal cheerleader, except way more efficient and without the pom-poms.

Still not convinced?

Think about it this way: before, only you (and maybe that one time you accidentally left a Stack Overflow answer open in public) knew how awesome you are. But now, there are at least 3 entities (you, me, and this package) that will recognize your work. That's a 200% increase in recognition!

How to Use:

    Install the package globally using npm:

Bash

npm install -g complimentinator-cpp

    Run complimentinator in your terminal:

Bash

complimentinator

    Sit back, relax, and bask in the glorious glow of your newfound (and slightly self-inflicted) appreciation.

Known Issues:

    May cause excessive smiling. Use with caution.

Why C++?

Because delivering compliments with maximum performance is serious business!  (Also, it's a fun way to demonstrate using native addons with Node.js.)

Contributing:

Pull requests are welcome! Especially for:

    More ridiculously over-the-top compliments (in any language!).
    Bug fixes (though hopefully there aren't any!).
    Improvements to the CLI or build process.
